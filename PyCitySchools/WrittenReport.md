I was able to calculate the averages for the columns of scores across the desired data frame and are able to  see the budget associated with the average scores, percentage passing across math and reading and percentage passing overall.  We are able to see the spending more Average Math Score decreased with the amount spent per student budget.  The same context can be read across this specific data frame for the other averages.

I was able to calculate the average of the subjects scores and the percentage of passing in each subject as well as the percentage overall passing.  All while filtering it through the school size.  And here we are able to perform the analysis that average math score had a lower grade average with a larger capacity school.  The same context can be read across all the data in this particular chart

A similar analysis can be made at the end as well.  This brings it into a whole but separates that whole by Charter and District.  You are able to analyze that overall, the Charter type averaged better grade scores across that spectrum as a whole.
