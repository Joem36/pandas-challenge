Here we were able to calculate the averages for the columns of scores across the desired data frame and are able to  see the budget associated with the average scores, percentage passing across math and reading and percentage passing overall.  We are able to see the spending more Average Math Score decreased with the amount spent per student budget.  The same context can be read across this specific data frame for the other averages.

Here we are able to calculate the average of the subjects scores and the percentage of passing in each subject as well as the percentage overall passing.

The same context can be read across all the data in this particular chart
