This project involves analyzing school performance data for PyCity Schools using Pandas. The goal is to explore and understand various metrics that indicate school performance, including student scores and school spending.

Analysis Summary
The analysis included several key steps:

Data Loading and Cleaning:

Merged school and student data to create a comprehensive dataset.
Calculated total number of unique schools, students, and the total budget.
District Summary:

Calculated overall average math and reading scores.
Determined the percentage of students passing math, reading, and both subjects.
School Summary:

Analyzed performance metrics for each school, including budget per student, average scores, and passing percentages.
Created a summary DataFrame with detailed performance metrics.
Comparative Analysis:

Sorted schools by overall passing rate to identify top and bottom performers.
Examined average scores by grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, and 12th).
Analyzed performance metrics based on school spending per student, school size, and school type (Charter vs. District).


Key Findings
Top Performing Schools: Charter schools like Cabrera High School and Thomas High School demonstrated the highest overall passing rates.
Budget Impact: Schools with lower per-student budgets tended to have higher overall passing rates.
School Size: Smaller and medium-sized schools generally performed better than larger schools.
School Type: Charter schools consistently outperformed district schools in both math and reading scores.
Tools and Libraries
Pandas: Used extensively for data manipulation, aggregation, and analysis.
Matplotlib: Utilized for data visualization (not shown in code but typically part of similar projects).
